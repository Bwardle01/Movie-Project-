Welcome to the sample GitHub ReadME! Use this template as an outline for your data analytics projects. Include one ReadME per repository, with each repository storing one project. Remember, it's better to have quality over quantity - having 2 stellar business-relevant projects stands out much more than 3+ mediocre projects. Feel free to make a copy of this or fork this repository and make it your own. Happy portfolio-ing :) 




# Project Background
IMDB, established in 1990, is a database that holds all current and past movies, TV shows, and other entertainment-related content.

The company has significant amounts of data on movies, TV shows, rankings, and sales. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover trends and critcial insights. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Most common and used genres:** An evaluation of all movie genres to see what genres are used the most. 
- **Average ranking by genre:** Evaluation of all rankings by genre to find out the average rankings by genre. 
- **Budget to movie ranking:** An assessment of movies to compare how much money was spent on the movie to the rank of the movie. 
- **Correlation between star power(# of well-known actors)and movie rankings:** Look at whether films featuring a higher number of prominent actors tend to get better reviews or higher ratings 

The SQL queries used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found here [link].

Targed SQL queries regarding various business questions can be found here [link].

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The companies main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: table1, table2, table3, table4, with a total row count of X records. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Table 2:**
- **Table 3:**
- **Table 4:**
- **Table 5:**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
